  <h4>Common Banking Fees</h4>

    <li><strong>Monthly maintenance fees:</strong> Some banks charge a monthly fee for maintaining your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Overdraft fees:</strong> If you spend more money than you have in your account, you may be charged an overdraft fee.</li>

    <h3>Establishing and Improving Credit</h3>
    <p>Your credit score is an important factor that lenders consider when you apply for credit, such as a loan or credit card. Here are some tips for establishing and improving your credit:</p>
  
    <h4>Establishing Credit</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apply for a secured credit card:</strong> A secured credit card requires a cash deposit, which serves as collateral for the credit limit. This can be a good option for building credit if you're unable to qualify for a traditional credit card.</li>
      <li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> Ask a family member or friend with good credit to add you as an authorized user on one of their credit cards. You'll be able to use the card, and your credit history will benefit from their responsible credit use.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply for a credit-builder loan:</strong> A credit-builder loan is a small loan that is designed to help you build credit. The loan proceeds are typically held in a savings account, and you make payments on the loan until it's paid off.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Improving Credit</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Make payments on time:</strong> Payment history is the most important factor in determining your credit score. Set up automatic payments or reminders to help you stay on top of your bills.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduce your credit utilization:</strong> Your credit utilization is the amount of credit you're using compared to your credit limit. Aim to keep your utilization below 30% to avoid negative impacts on your credit score.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor your credit report:</strong> Check your credit report regularly for errors or fraudulent activity. You can request a free credit report once per year from each of the three major credit bureaus.</li>
